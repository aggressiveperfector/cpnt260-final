## Comments
1. Used a conventional static menu instead of responsive "hamburger" menu due to personal limitations/upcoming lessons surrounding javascript.
 2. I've opted to use a small logo for the top-left section of the navigation bar instead of a company name. This is common practice used by [Nike](https://www.nike.com/ca/), [Oakley](https://www.oakley.com/en-ca), [Puma](https://ca.puma.com/), and other modern companies. I realize the assignment requires name and the logo is optional but hope you will see the reasoning behind this decision. Will change this portion to responsive and include company name once the course progresses further. 
3. Focused on a mobile first approach for the responsive Gallery and Contact pages which include multiple smaller sections (photo figures/cards).
4. Used existing photography + branding from a previous personal/education project. [Old personal portfolio site](http://michaelmardell.ca/) with a bit more about Thorogood.
